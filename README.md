# Screentime

> A chrome extension for keeping track and managing your time on sites that distract. You can set the maximum number of minutes you want to spend on each site daily. You can also set time frames when those sites should be inaccessible. Four sites are set by default `Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram` but you can go ahead and add or remove sites.

## Project Setup

npm install
```

## Package extension
```
npm run build

Go to `chrome://extensions` on your chrome browser. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the dist folder
